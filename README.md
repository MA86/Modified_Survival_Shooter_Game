# Modified Survival Shooter Game:
We modified one of Unity's sample games, called Survival Shooter, to allow human heart rate to control the speed of movement in the game. Two 'Player' scripts were modified, and also, a new 'HeartBPM' script was added to the Player object in the scene. This project is in prototype stage.
