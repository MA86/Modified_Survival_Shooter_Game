# Modified Survival Shooter Game:
We modified one of Unity's sample games, called Survival Shooter, to allow the player's heart rate to control the speed of the player's movement in the game. Two 'Player' scripts were modified, and also, a new 'HeartBPM' script was added to the Player object in the scene. This project is in prototype stage.
